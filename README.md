RE-DACT Toolkit 🔒

An AI-powered toolkit for detecting, redacting, and (optionally) reversibly encrypting sensitive PII (Personally Identifiable Information) in images, videos, documents, and audio files.

🚀 Features

🔍 Detects names, phone numbers, addresses, emails, IDs, and more.

🖼️ Redacts images, videos, and PDFs by blurring or masking sensitive info.

🎙️ Supports audio redaction by replacing detected PII with a beep.

🔐 Provides reversible encryption (instead of permanent deletion) for authorized recovery.

📊 Notebook-based pipeline for easy experimentation and customization.
